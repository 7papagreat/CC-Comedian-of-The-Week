            <h4>Stand-up comedy</h4>
            <img class="specials" width="40%"src="specials.jpg" alt="specials">
            <p class="text"> Kreischer's first experience with stand-up comedy was at Potbelly's, a bar and nightclub in Tallahassee, Florida. Kreischer moved to New York City after a tape of one of his sets was sent to a talent agent who invited him to the city to watch some stand-up shows. Kreischer worked the door at the now-defunct Boston Comedy Club.

                Kreischer is known for performing stand-up comedy while shirtless. He is also known for his storytelling; his most popular story is about how he allegedly earned the nickname "The Machine". The story revolves around how he inadvertently helped the Russian mafia rob a train while on a college trip to Russia.

                In 2004 Kreischer was featured along with four other comedians on the DVD release National Lampoon Live: New Faces - Volume 2. That same year one of his stories appeared on an episode of the animated Comedy Central series Shorties Watchin' Shorties.

                As a stand-up comedian Kreischer has performed internationally and has appeared on late night talk shows Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live and Conan. He also appeared regularly as a guest on Rachael Ray from 2011 to 2015.

                In 2009 his first comedy special Bert Kreischer: Comfortably Dumb appeared on Comedy Central. His second special Bert Kreischer: The Machine was released in 2016 on Showtime.

                In 2015 he appeared on Comedy Central's comedy storytelling series This Is Not Happening. His story for the show was about his experience wrestling a bear for the television series Hurt Bert.

                In August 2018, Kreisher released Bert Kreischer: Secret Time on Netflix, Filming took places in Philadelphia.

                In March 2020, Kreisher released Bert Kreischer: Hey Big Boy on Netflix, Filming took place in Cleveland.</p>
        <h4>Podcasting</h4>
        <p class="text">
            Kreischer produces and hosts Bertcast, a weekly comedy podcast on the All Things Comedy network. Launched in 2012, Bert records his podcast from his Man Cave that was built for him for an episode of Man Caves, a home renovation reality television program. Kreischer co-hosts the 2 Bears 1 Cave podcast with Tom Segura, and the Bill and Bert podcast with Bill Burr. Kreischer has also been a guest on podcasts such as WTF with Marc Maron, Doug Benson's Doug Loves Movies, H3 Podcast, Your Mom's House and The Joe Rogan Experience.
        </p>
        <h4>Other Media</h4>
        <p class="text">Within five months of moving to New York City to pursue a career in comedy, Will Smith's Production Company offered Kreischer a deal for a sitcom. When he was featured on Bert the Conqueror, Kreischer traveled to amusement parks and other entertainment venues across the United States in order to experience thrilling rides and activities. Kreischer, who suffers from a fear of heights, can be seen riding roller coasters and other amusement park rides as well as engaging in activities such as jumping off the Stratosphere tower in Las Vegas and being fired from a human slingshot. While in New York Kreischer attended open mics hosted by TV producer DJ Nash that were also attended by the likes of Demetri Martin, Bobby Kelly and Jim Norton. In 2001 Kreischer also starred in a television pilot based on Nash's life titled Life With David J.</p>
